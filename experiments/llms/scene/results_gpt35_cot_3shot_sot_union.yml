Human[instruction]: Please install the stringer in the location where my finger is pointing and adjust the speed adaptively.
Robot[thought]: I notice that I am currently in the deliver_space with an open gripper and not holding any object. The human wants me to install a stringer in the location where their finger is pointing. They also mentioned adjusting the speed adaptively, which means I need to set a suitable speed for the task. I should move to the assembly_space to get the scene description and find the location where the human's finger is pointing. Then, I can grasp the stringer from the part_space and move it to the desired location.
Robot[question]: None.
