Human[instruction]: Please move the stringer to the location where my finger is pointing and adjust the speed adaptively.
Robot[thought]: The human wants me to move the stringer to the location where their finger is pointing. I need to first determine the assembly position of the finger, then move the stringer to that location. Additionally, I need to adjust my speed adaptively to ensure safe and accurate movement.
Robot[question]: Where is the assembly position of your finger? Can you please provide more information or point to the specific location?
Robot[code]:
# Step 1: Get the assembly position of the finger.
finger_assembly_poses = get_pointed_assembly_location("assembly_space")
# Step 2: Adjust the speed adaptively based on the distance between the current location and the finger assembly position.
current_loc = get_current_location()
distance = calculate_distance(current_loc, finger_assembly_poses[0])
speed = calculate_adaptive_speed(distance)
# Step 3: Set the speed to the calculated adaptive speed.
set_speed(speed)
# Step 4: Move the stringer to the finger assembly position.
move_to_location_by_trajectory(finger_assembly_poses)
# Step 5: Open the gripper to release the stringer.
open_gripper()
# Step 6: Move back to a safe location.
safe_loc = get_safe_location("stringer", finger_assembly_poses[-1])
move_to_location(safe_loc)
# Step 7: Move to the deliver_space to wait for further instructions.
move_to_location("deliver_space")

# 16. move the stringer to human finger pointed location (not in gripper, need adjusting speed, not clearly appoint)
Space[observation]: [tool_space: ["one phillips screwdriver", "one slotted screwdriver", "one hex screwdriver"]; part_space: ["one battery", "four stringers", "one signal interface board"]; assembly_space: ["framework"]]
Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "open"; grasped: "None"]
Human[instruction]: Please install the stringer in the location where my finger is pointing and adjust the speed adaptively.Robot[thought]: The human wants me to install the stringer in the location where their finger is pointing. I need to determine the assembly position of the finger, move to that position, grasp the stringer from the part_space, move to the assembly position, and release the stringer. Additionally, I need to adjust my speed adaptively based on the human's finger movement.

Please note that in Step 13, the "adaptive_speed" variable should be replaced with the actual speed value that is determined based on the human's finger movement.
