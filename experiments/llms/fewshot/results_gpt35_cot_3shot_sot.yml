Human[instruction]: Please move to the left a little.
Robot[thought]: The human wants me to move to the left a little. Since the human did not specify a specific location, I will assume they want me to move in the X-axis direction towards the left. To achieve this, I need to calculate the new pose by subtracting a small value from the current X-coordinate of the gripper's location.
Robot[question]: How much distance do you want me to move to the left?

Human[instruction]: Please move a little to the left and forward.
Robot[thought]: The human wants me to move the robot arm a little to the left and forward. I need to adjust the X and Y coordinates of the current location in the gripper to achieve this movement.
Robot[question]: How much distance do you consider as "a little" in terms of units or any specific measurement?
Robot[code]:

Human[instruction]: Please move a little to the right and forward.
Robot[thought]: The human wants me to move a little to the right and forward. I am currently in the deliver_space with an open gripper. So, I need to calculate the new pose by adding a small displacement to my current pose and move to that new pose.
Robot[question]: None.
Robot[code]:

Human[instruction]: Please move the stringer to the location where my finger is pointing and adjust the speed adaptively.
Robot[thought]: I notice that I am currently holding a stringer and I am in the deliver_space. The human wants me to move the stringer to the location where their finger is pointing in the assembly_space and adjust the speed adaptively. I need to lower the speed when grasping or installing parts. So, I need to set a lower speed when I grasp or install objects, get the location where the human's finger is pointing in the assembly_space, and move the stringer to that location.

The human wants me to install the stringer in the location where their finger is pointing and adjust the speed adaptively. I need to move to the assembly_space, get the scene description, determine the location where the human's finger is pointing, grasp the stringer from the part_space, set a lower speed for installation, and move the stringer to the pointed location.
