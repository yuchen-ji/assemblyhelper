# 15. move forward by 10mm
Space[observation]: [tool_space: ["phillips screwdriver", "slotted screwdriver", "hex screwdriver"]; part_space: ["battery", "four stringers", "signal interface board"]; assembly_space: ["framework"]]
Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "open"; grasped: "None"]
Human[instruction]: Please move forward by 10 mm.
Robot[thought]: I understand that you want me to move forward by 10 mm. Since I am currently in the deliver_space with an open gripper and not grasping anything, I can directly move forward by the specified distance.

Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "open"; grasped: "None"]
Human[instruction]: Please move up by 30 mm.
Robot[thought]: I understand that you want the robot to move up by 30 mm. Since the robot is currently in the deliver_space with the gripper open, I need to calculate the new position and move the robot accordingly.
Robot[code]:
# Step 1: Get the current location of the gripper
current_location = get_current_location()
# Step 2: Calculate the new position by moving up by 30 mm
new_position = (current_location[0], current_location[1], current_location[2] + 30, current_location[3], current_location[4], current_location[5])

Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "open"; grasped: "None"]
Human[instruction]: Please move to the left a little.
Robot[thought]: I understand that you want me to move to the left a little. To do this, I will need to determine the current location of the gripper and calculate the new desired location. Then, I will move the gripper to the new location.
Robot[code]:
# Step 1: Get the current location of the gripper
current_location = get_current_location()
# Step 2: Calculate the new desired location by moving to the left
new_location = current_location
new_location[1] -= 0.1  # Adjust the Y-coordinate to move to the left by 0.1 units
# Step 3: Move the gripper to the new desired location
move_to_location(new_location)

Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "open"; grasped: "None"]
Human[instruction]: Please move to the right a little.
Robot[thought]: I understand that you want me to move to the right a little. To do this, I need to calculate the new pose by adjusting the current gripper location.
Robot[code]:
# Step 1: Get the current gripper location
current_location = get_current_location()
# Step 2: Calculate the new pose by adjusting the current location
new_location = current_location
new_location[1] += 0.1  # Adjust the Y-axis (right) by 0.1 units
# Step 3: Move to the new location
move_to_location(new_location)

# 21. move to the [left, forward] a little
Space[observation]: [tool_space: ["phillips screwdriver", "slotted screwdriver", "hex screwdriver"]; part_space: ["battery", "four stringers", "signal interface board"]; assembly_space: ["framework"]]
Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "open"; grasped: "None"]
Human[instruction]: Please move a little to the left and forward.
Robot[thought]: I understand that you want me to move a little to the left and forward. To do this, I will need to calculate the new pose based on the current gripper location and the desired movement direction.
Robot[code]:
# Step 1: Get the current gripper location
current_location = get_current_location()
# Step 2: Calculate the new pose by moving a little to the left and forward
new_pose = {
    "x": current_location["x"] - 0.1,  # Move 0.1 units to the left
    "y": current_location["y"] + 0.1,  # Move 0.1 units forward
    "z": current_location["z"],       # Maintain the same height

Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "open"; grasped: "None"; speed: "0.5"]
Human[instruction]: Please move a little to the right and forward.
Robot[thought]: To move a little to the right and forward, I need to adjust the X and Y coordinates of my current location in the positive X and Y directions.
Robot[code]:
```python
# Step 1: Get the current location
current_loc = get_current_location()
# Step 2: Calculate the new location by moving a little to the right and forward
new_x = current_loc[0] + 5  # Move 5 units forward in the positive X direction
new_y = current_loc[1] + 5  # Move 5 units to the right in the positive Y direction
new_z = current_loc[2]  # Maintain the current height
new_pose = [new_x, new_y, new_z, current_loc[3], current_loc[4], current_loc[5]]  # Keep the current orientation
# Step 3: Move to the new location
move_to_location(new_pose)

Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "open"; grasped: "None"; speed: "0.5"]
Human[instruction]: Please move 30mm to the left rear.
Robot[thought]: To move 30mm to the left rear, I need to calculate the new pose based on the current gripper location and the given instruction.
Robot[code]:
```python
# Step 1: Get the current gripper location
current_pose = get_current_location()
# Step 2: Calculate the new pose by moving 30mm to the left rear
new_pose = current_pose
new_pose[1] -= 30  # Move 30mm to the left (Y-axis)
new_pose[0] -= 30  # Move 30mm rearward (X-axis)
# Step 3: Move to the calculated new pose
move_to_location(new_pose)
```

Human[instruction]: Move 50 and 40mm to the right and rear respectively.
Robot[thought]: I understand that you want me to move 50mm to the right and 40mm to the rear. Since I am currently in the deliver_space with an open gripper and not grasping anything, I can directly move to the desired location.
Robot[code]:
# Step 1: Calculate the target pose by moving 50mm to the right and 40mm to the rear
target_pose = get_current_location()
target_pose[1] += 50  # Move 50mm to the right (positive Y-axis)
target_pose[0] -= 40  # Move 40mm to the rear (negative X-axis)

Human[instruction]: Stop and move back to deliver_space.
Robot[thought]: I need to stop any ongoing movement and move back to the deliver_space.
Robot[code]:
```python
