4. Open the gripper to release any previously grasped object.
5. Move the gripper to a safe location before grasping the stringer in the part space.
6. Close the gripper to grasp the stringer.
7. Move the gripper to a safe location in the deliver space to complete the task.
Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

# 9. pick up the signal interface board, then move to the deliver_space
Space[observation]: [tool_space: ["phillips screwdriver", "slotted screwdriver", "hex screwdriver"]; part_space: ["battery", "four stringers", "signal interface board"]; assembly_space: ["framework"]]
Robot[sensor]: [location: "part_space"; gripper: "close"; grasped: "None"]
Human[instruction]: Please move the signal interface board to the deliver space.
Based on the information provided, it seems that the signal interface board is currently in the part_space and the gripper is closed. To fulfill your request of moving the signal interface board to the deliver space, I will need to perform the following steps:
1. Open the gripper to release any currently grasped object.
2. Move the gripper to a safe location to pass through before and after grasping the signal interface board.
3. Move the gripper to the signal interface board's location in the part_space.
4. Close the gripper to grasp the signal interface board.
5. Move the gripper to the deliver space.
6. Open the gripper to release the signal interface board.
Here is the robot control code to complete the task:
Robot[code]:
```
# Step 1: Open the gripper
open_gripper()
# Step 2: Move to a safe location
safe_location = get_safe_location("signal interface board", "part_space")
move_to_location(safe_location)
# Step 3: Move to the signal interface board's location
signal_interface_board_location = get_scene_descriptions()["part_space"]["signal interface board"]
move_to_location(signal_interface_board_location)
# Step 4: Close the gripper to grasp the signal interface board
close_gripper()
# Step 5: Move to the deliver space
deliver_space_location = get_scene_descriptions()["deliver_space"]
move_to_location(deliver_space_location)
# Step 6: Open the gripper to release the signal interface board
open_gripper()
```
Please note that this code assumes that the deliver space is a predefined location and its 6D pose is stored in the scene descriptions.

# 10. pick up the phillips screwdriver (Not exist)

Human[instruction]: Please pick up the phillips screwdriver.
Robot[thought]: To pick up the Phillips screwdriver, I need to move to the tool space, grasp the screwdriver, and then move back to the deliver space.
Robot[code]:
1. Move to the tool space.
2. Open the gripper.
3. Move to the location of the Phillips screwdriver.
4. Close the gripper.
5. Move back to the deliver space.
Please note that I assume the Phillips screwdriver is in the tool space. If it is not, please let me know.
Here is the code:
```python
# Step 1: Move to the tool space
move_to_location(tool_space)
# Step 2: Open the gripper
open_gripper()
# Step 3: Move to the location of the Phillips screwdriver
move_to_location_by_trajectory(get_safe_location("Phillips screwdriver", "tool_space"))
# Step 4: Close the gripper
