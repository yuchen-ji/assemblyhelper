Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "open"; grasped: "None"]
Human[instruction]: Please move to the left a little.
Robot[thought]: To move to the left, we need to adjust the position of the robot arm in the X-axis direction.
Robot[code]:
move_to_location_by_trajectory([(current_location[0] - 0.1, current_location[1], current_location[2], current_location[3], current_location[4], current_location[5])])

# 14. move the stringer to human finger pointed location (not in gripper, need adjusting speed)
Space[observation]: [tool_space: ["phillips screwdriver", "slotted screwdriver", "hex screwdriver"]; part_space: ["battery", "four stringers", "signal interface board"]; assembly_space: ["framework"]]
Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "open"; grasped: "None"]
Human[instruction]: Please install the stringer to the location where my finger is pointing, use a lower speed when grasping or installing parts.
Robot[thought]: I understand that you want me to install the stringer to the location where your finger is pointing. You also requested to use a lower speed when grasping or installing parts. To accomplish this, I need to move to the assembly space, get the location where your finger is pointing, grasp the stringer, and install it at the specified location.
Robot[code]:
1. Set the robot's speed to a 30% rate.
   set_speed(0.3)
2. Move to the assembly space.
   move_to_location("assembly_space")
3. Get the trajectory sequence to move to the assembly position of your finger.
   assembly_space_des = get_scene_descriptions()
   assembly_loc_seq = get_pointed_assembly_location(assembly_space_des)
4. Move to the assembly position of your finger using the trajectory sequence.
   move_to_location_by_trajectory(assembly_loc_seq)
5. Grasp the stringer from the part space.
   move_to_location("part_space")
   part_space_des = get_scene_descriptions()
   stringer_loc = get_storage_location(part_space_des, "stringer")
   safe_stringer_loc = get_safe_location("stringer", stringer_loc)
   move_to_location(safe_stringer_loc)
   open_gripper()
   move_to_location(stringer_loc)
   close_gripper()
   move_to_location(safe_stringer_loc)
6. Install the stringer to the location where your finger is pointing.
   move_to_location_by_trajectory(assembly_loc_seq)

# 15. move the stringer to human finger pointed location (in gripper, need adjusting speed, not clearly appoint)
Space[observation]: [tool_space: ["phillips screwdriver", "slotted screwdriver", "hex screwdriver"]; part_space: ["battery", "three stringers", "signal interface board"]; assembly_space: ["framework"]]
Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "close"; grasped: "stringer"]
Human[instruction]: Please move the stringer to the location where my finger is pointing and adjust the speed adaptively.
Robot[thought]: I understand that you want me to move the stringer to the location where your finger is pointing. I also need to adjust the speed adaptively. To do this, I will first calculate the trajectory sequence to move the gripper to the assembly position of your finger. Then, I will move the gripper to that position while adjusting the speed accordingly.
Robot[code]:
pointed_assembly_loc_seq = get_pointed_assembly_location("assembly_space")
set_speed(adaptive_speed)
move_to_location_by_trajectory(pointed_assembly_loc_seq)
Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.

# 16. move the stringer to human finger pointed location (not in gripper, need adjusting speed, not clearly appoint)
Space[observation]: [tool_space: ["phillips screwdriver", "slotted screwdriver", "hex screwdriver"]; part_space: ["battery", "four stringers", "signal interface board"]; assembly_space: ["framework"]]
Robot[sensor]: [location: "deliver_space"; gripper: "open"; grasped: "None"]
Human[instruction]: Please install the stringer to the location where my finger is pointing and adjust the speed adaptively.Robot[thought]: To install the stringer to the location where your finger is pointing, I need to first move to the assembly space and adjust the speed adaptively based on the finger's position.
Robot[code]:
1. Move to the assembly space:
   - Move to the tool space to avoid collisions:
     move_to_location("tool_space")
   - Get the safe location to pass through before and after grasping the stringer:
     safe_tool_loc = get_safe_location("stringer", "tool_space")
   - Move to the safe tool location:
     move_to_location(safe_tool_loc)
   - Open the gripper:
     open_gripper()
   - Move to the assembly space:
     move_to_location("assembly_space")
2. Adjust the speed adaptively based on the finger's position:
   - Get the trajectory sequence of 6D poses that moves to the assembly position of the finger:
     finger_traj = get_pointed_assembly_location("assembly_space")
   - Set the speed adaptively based on the finger's position:
     set_speed(adaptive_speed(finger_traj))
3. Install the stringer to the pointed location:
   - Get the current location of the gripper:
     current_loc = get_current_location()
   - Move to the location where your finger is pointing:
     move_to_location_by_trajectory(finger_traj)
   - Close the gripper to grasp the stringer:
     close_gripper()
   - Move back to the previous location:
     move_to_location(current_loc)
Note: The adaptive_speed() function is a hypothetical function that adjusts the robot's speed based on the finger's position. You can implement this function based on your specific requirements.
Please let me know if you have any further instructions or if you need any additional assistance.
