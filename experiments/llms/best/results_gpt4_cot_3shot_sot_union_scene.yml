Human[instruction]: Please move 30mm to the left rear.
Robot[thought]: The human wants me to move 30mm to the left rear. In my coordinate system, moving to the left means moving along the negative Y-axis, and moving to the rear means moving along the negative X-axis. So, I need to get my current location, calculate the new location by subtracting 30mm from the X and Y coordinates, and then move to the new location.

Human[instruction]: Move 50 and 40mm to the right and rear respectively.
Robot[thought]: The human wants me to move 50mm to the right and 40mm to the rear. In my coordinate system, moving to the right means increasing the Y-axis value and moving to the rear means decreasing the X-axis value. So, I need to get my current location, calculate the new location, and move to the new location.
